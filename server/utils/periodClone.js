/**
 * Clone-on-first-use helper.
 *
 * cloneFromPriorPeriod(model, currentPeriodId, opts) — when the user
 * switches to a period that has NO rows yet for `model`, this helper
 * copies rows from the immediate chronological PREDECESSOR period
 * into the current period as a starting point.
 *
 * "Predecessor" is computed from the actual school year + semester:
 *   - If current is Sem 2, the predecessor is Sem 1 of the same year.
 *   - If current is Summer, the predecessor is Sem 2 of the same year.
 *   - If current is Sem 1, the predecessor is the trailing term
 *     (Summer, then Sem 2) of the previous school year.
 *
 * Insertion order does NOT influence the search — adding 2025-2026
 * *after* 2026-2027 must not cause cloning from the older year when
 * the user creates 2026-2027 Sem 2.
 *
 * The search starts from the immediate predecessor and walks
 * backwards in time. The first predecessor that actually has data
 * for `model` becomes the source. If nothing earlier has data,
 * nothing is cloned.
 *
 * After the copy, the two periods are completely independent — each
 * row has its own `id`, both carry their own `period_id`, and edits
 * to one period don't touch the other.
 *
 * `attributes`  the columns to read from the source row
 * `transform`   optional row-by-row transform; defaults to identity
 * `updateKeys`  columns to UPDATE on conflict during the copy
 *
 * Returns:
 *   null               — nothing was cloned (no prior period had data)
 *   { count, source }  — count cloned + source period id
